   SEQS PROCESSOR HELP:   
   -------------------    

   Input file must be in FASTA format. Description of output:

   if no translation frame is chosen "0" then four output files will be generated:
   1. *.fasta - contains processed sequences in FASTA format
   2. *.stat  - contains information about GC% content per sequence
   3. *.tab   - tab delimited file with sequences
   4. *.01BIN - binary DNA representation (A-00 T-11 G-01 C-10)

   if first translation frame is chosen "1" then eleven output files will be generated:
   1. *.fasta - contains processed sequences in FASTA format
   2. *.forwrd - forward orientation, all non ATGCN letters replaced by "N"
   3. *.revcom - reverse-compliment orientation based on "forward" sequences
   4. *.stat  - contains information about GC% content per sequence
   5. *.tab   - tab delimited file with sequences
   6. *.tr_frame1 - translated sequences - frame 1
   7. *.tr_longest_frame - extracted longest frame
   8. *.tr_single_frame - extracted sequences with single ORF
   9. *.x0_log - log file with general info and error messages
  10. *.x1_log - log file with statistical info about translation - frame 1
  11. *.01BIN - binary DNA representation (A-00 T-11 G-01 C-10)

   if three translation frames are chosen "3" then sixteen output files will be generated:
   1. *.fasta - contains processed sequences in FASTA format
   2. *.forwrd - forward orientation, all non ATGCN letters replaced by "N"
   3. *.revcom - reverse-compliment orientation based on "forward" sequences
   4. *.stat  - contains information about GC% content per sequence
   5. *.tab   - tab delimited file with sequences
   6. *.tr_frame1 - translated sequences - frame 1
   7. *.tr_frame2 - translated sequences - frame 2
   8. *.tr_frame3 - translated sequences - frame 3
   9. *.tr_longest_frame - extracted longest frame
  10. *.tr_single_frame - extracted sequences with single ORF
  11. *.x0_log - log file with general info and error messages
  12. *.x1_log - log file with statistical info about translation - frame 1
  13. *.x2_log - log file with statistical info about translation - frame 2
  14. *.x3_log - log file with statistical info about translation - frame 3
  15. *.xx_log - log file with statistical info about all three translation ORFs
  16. *.01BIN - binary DNA representation (A-00 T-11 G-01 C-10)

   if six translation frames are chosen "6" then twenty two output files will be generated:
   1. *.fasta - contains processed sequences in FASTA format
   2. *.forwrd - forward orientation, all non ATGCN letters replaced by "N"
   3. *.revcom - reverse-compliment orientation based on "forward" sequences
   4. *.stat  - contains information about GC% content per sequence
   5. *.tab   - tab delimited file with sequences
   6. *.tr_frame1 - translated sequences - frame 1
   7. *.tr_frame2 - translated sequences - frame 2
   8. *.tr_frame3 - translated sequences - frame 3
   9. *.tr_frame4 - translated sequences - frame 4
  10. *.tr_frame5 - translated sequences - frame 5
  11. *.tr_frame6 - translated sequences - frame 6
  12. *.tr_longest_frame - extracted longest frame
  13. *.tr_single_frame - extracted sequences with single ORF
  14. *.x0_log - log file with general info and error messages
  15. *.x1_log - log file with statistical info about translation - frame 1
  16. *.x2_log - log file with statistical info about translation - frame 2
  17. *.x3_log - log file with statistical info about translation - frame 3
  18. *.x4_log - log file with statistical info about translation - frame 4
  19. *.x5_log - log file with statistical info about translation - frame 5
  20. *.x6_log - log file with statistical info about translation - frame 6
  21. *.xx_log - log file with statistical info about all six translation ORFs
  22. *.01BIN - binary DNA representation (A-00 T-11 G-01 C-10)

  Note, log files must be viewed using Excel like spreadsheet editor
